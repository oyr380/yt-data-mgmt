# Large Scale Data Management Project Repository


Todo

* refactor downloader script using functions 
* Write json parser script to remove unwanted values (cleaning)
* Write script to find all .info.json files and parse out video ID value. Add IDs to archive.txt file
* Write script to clean up batch_vids.txt and archive.txt files, removing duplicate lines
* Script finding partial/broken .json files (hoping there's a nice library that throws an error when reading busted ones)

Done
* Update metadata_downloader to include arguments directly
